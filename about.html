    About Adrian Hanna
   </h2>
   <p>
    I’m Adrian — a passionate adventurer, network engineer, and someone who has experienced the grounding force of nature firsthand. From working IT infrastructure at sea to exploring remote high desert plateaus, my life has always revolved around motion, grit, and connection. I’ve seen both the speed of the digital world and the silence of wilderness. And I’ve found that the latter often holds the most answers.
   </p>
   <p>
    My journey hasn’t always been smooth. Like many, I’ve faced periods of emotional hardship, spiritual doubt, and burnout. But through hiking rugged trails, sleeping under stars, and listening to wind move through pines, I found my way back to clarity and inner peace. That’s what I want to offer you.
   </p>

   <h2>
    My Mission
   </h2>
   <p>
    The American Backpacker is more than a guide company — it’s a calling. I help people unplug, decompress, and reconnect with what matters. Whether you're coming out of a hard life chapter, recovering from emotional trauma, or just need time to think clearly, these trips are designed to give you space, beauty, and strength.
   </p>
   <p>
    My goal is to help you reset. To witness places of profound geological power and timelessness. To walk beside you — not just as a guide, but as someone who understands that sometimes, you need the wild to feel human again.
   </p>
   <h2>
    For Those Who Are Struggling
   </h2>
   <p>
    If you’re carrying grief, depression, anxiety, or simply feel lost in today’s fast-paced culture — this is your trailhead. Nature doesn’t rush, it doesn’t compete, and it never turns away those who show up. I believe deeply in using landscapes as medicine. Let’s walk together toward something new.
   </p>
